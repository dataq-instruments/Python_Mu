# Python_Mu
A Mu project for DI-1110, DI-2108, DI-4108, DI-4208

To use the example in Windows, 

**Prerequisites**:

Install Python

Install Pyserial

Turn 21xx/11xx/41xx/47xx into CDC mode: plug the device to USB port, if the LED already blinks Yellow, stop, you are already in CDC mode. If not, once the LED turns blinking Green, push and hold the button immediately (within 5 second time frame), the LED should turn white, hold until LED turns Red, then release the button, now the LED will blink yellow to indicate CDC mode. If you need to exit CDC mode, repeate the same action and a green blinking LED will indicate LibUSB mode.

From Device Manager, find out the COM port of the device connected to, and modify the program accordingly
